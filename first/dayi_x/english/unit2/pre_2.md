## Try to be gender-neutral, Not must

   There exists some sexism in English, Chinese, Greek, Latin or other language. It is a common phenomenon in language, and meanwhile, it can be natural if we consider  human's history. Of course, nowadays, equality between male and female is quite important. So I think we should try to use gender-neutral language as much as possiable, but not have to use gender-neutral language at all occations.

   But how can we use gender-neutral language? We can try to make sexist language become gender-neutral. For example, we can use some gender-neutral words when it's possible. we can refer the man making a speech in a formal situation as "speakperson" instead of "speakman". And when we sort two names, they should be arranged in alphabetical order, rather than always placing male names before female names. There are many things we can do in our everyday lives.

   And, of course, we should not use gender-neutral terms when the word is extremely rare. In my opinion, it's not necessary to do this. In this occation, we use the word, which might be a little sexist, because it's convinent, and this will not lead to inequality between male and female. The thought of equality in our mind counts, but not the every exact word we use. 

   That's my opinion towards question 3. Thanks for listening!!
